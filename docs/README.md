## Description

This project is to showcase how to implement event driven architecture using AWS SNS FIFO and SQS FIFO.

It is the practical part of the article
[Can we implement Event-Driven Architecture with AWS Kinesis orÂ SNS?](https://medium.com/@hussin.ghrer/)

The project represents an eCommerce platform which handles placing orders, payments,
shipment and emailing.

## Architecture

### Events

The following diagrams show some of the events and their flow

### Abstract Architecture

The Order, Payment, and Shipping services all emit and consume events.
Therefore, each of these services has Event Publisher and Event Subscriber components.
On the other hand, the Inventory and Email services only consume events,
so they only have Event Subscriber components.

### Architecture Using SNS FIFO and SQS FIFO

We are going to replace the abstracted event channel with real components.

Since we are handling only events related to orders, so we need only one SNS FIFO Topic to
publish events to. Let's name it `orders-topic.fifo`.

For each service which consumes events, a SQS FIFO is to be created for it. Therefore,
`orders-topic-payments.fifo` is the SQS which subscribes to `orders-topic.fifo` and filters all the events
which should be handled by payments service.

## Run The Services

`chmod +x docker-up.sh`
